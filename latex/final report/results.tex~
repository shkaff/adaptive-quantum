By the moment this project is still running, so there are some results, that we can present,but there are a lot of issues to be studied.
Main results we achieved:
\begin{itemize}
 \item created adaptive approach for quantum measurements,
 \item applied this approach to model task and got estimation of two parameters of the force (see Fig. \label{pic:hom}),
 \item compared the precision of the adaptive measurements with variation readout and measurements with fixed homodyne angle (see Tab. \ref{set1}).
\end{itemize}

Summarizing these results we can say, that precision of adaptive measurements is better, than for fixed homodyne angle, but still worse than for variational measurements (with known arrival time).
So, we can conclude, that adaptive measurements can be better than conventional one and can provide more flexibility than variational (because they 
provide an opportunity to estimate both arrival time and amplitude of the force). But these conclusions are just speculation about the result. To get 
precise answer on the questions we arose in the introduction section, we should continue our work.

Of course, these preliminary results can only inspire our future investigation in this field. Our next step in this work is understanding of all
mathematical properties of the algorithm and making more statistics on it. This will help us to realize possible improvements and problems in the 
approach. In prospect we want to generalize the algorithm and apply it to some more realistic case.

% Our algorithm rotates homodyne angle for getting the best estimation by means of cancelling the back action. On Fig. \ref{alpha_10} (left) we can see, how homodyne angle depends on time.

% Also we can see how our algorithm estimates the arrival time (See  Fig. \ref{alpha_10} (right)). Then for compartment we place how estimation algorithm works in adaptive measurements and in measurements with fixed homodyne angle (see Fig.\ref{FbAb}).
