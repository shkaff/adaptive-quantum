abstract = {The LIGO-II gravitational-wave interferometers (ca. 2006--2008) are designed to have sensitivities at about the standard quantum limit (SQL) near 100 Hz. This paper describes and analyzes possible designs for subsequent, LIGO-III interferometers that can beat the SQL. These designs are identical to a conventional broad-band interferometer (without signal recycling), except for new input and/or output optics. Three designs are analyzed: (i) a "squeezed-input interferometer" (conceived by Unruh based on earlier work of Caves) in which squeezed vacuum with frequency-dependent (FD) squeeze angle is injected into the interferometer's dark port; (ii) a "variational-output" interferometer (conceived in a different form by Vyatchanin, Matsko and Zubova), in which homodyne detection with FD homodyne phase is performed on the output light; and (iii) a "squeezed-variational interferometer" with squeezed input and FD-homodyne output. It is shown that the FD squeezed-input light can be produced by sending ordinary squeezed light through two successive Fabry-Perot filter cavities before injection into the interferometer, and FD-homodyne detection can be achieved by sending the output light through two filter cavities before ordinary homodyne detection. With anticipated technology and with laser powers comparable to that planned for LIGO-II, these interferometers can beat the amplitude SQL by factors in the range from 3 to 5, corresponding to event rate increases between \~{}30 and \~{}100 over the rate for a SQL-limited interferometer.},

Sanders and G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 2944 (1995)], it yields a variance (Deltastraight phi)(2) approximately pi(2)/N2, compared to O(N-1) or O(N-1/2) for states considered by previous authors. Such a measurement cannot be realized by counting photons in the interferometer outputs. However, we introduce an adaptive measurement scheme that can be thus realized, and show that it yields a variance in straight phi very close to that from an optimal measurement.},

abstract = {Quantum entanglement in the motion of macroscopic solid bodies has implications both for quantum technologies and foundational studies of the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds. Entanglement is usually fragile in room-temperature solids, owing to strong interactions both internally and with the noisy environment. We generated motional entanglement between vibrational states of two spatially separated, millimeter-sized diamonds at room temperature. By measuring strong nonclassical correlations between Raman-scattered photons, we showed that the quantum state of the diamonds has positive concurrence with 98\% probability. Our results show that entanglement can persist in the classical context of moving macroscopic solids in ambient conditions.},

@article{Safavi-Naeini2011,
abstract = {We present optical sideband spectroscopy measurements of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator cooled near its quantum ground state. The mechanical oscillator, corresponding to a 3.99GHz acoustic mode of a patterned silicon nanobeam, is coupled via radiation pressure to a pair of co-localized 200THz optical modes. The mechanical mode is cooled close to its quantum ground state from a bath temperature of 18K using radiation pressure back-action stemming from the optical pumping of one of the optical cavity resonances. An optical probe beam, resonant with the second optical cavity resonance, is used to transduce the mechanical motion and determine the phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode. Measurement of the asymmetry between up-converted and down-converted photons of the probe beam yields directly the displacement noise power associated with the quantum zero-point motion of the mechanical oscillator, and provides an absolute calibration of the average phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode.},

abstract = {The LIGO-II gravitational-wave interferometers (ca. 2006--2008) are designed to have sensitivities at about the standard quantum limit (SQL) near 100 Hz. This paper describes and analyzes possible designs for subsequent, LIGO-III interferometers that can beat the SQL. These designs are identical to a conventional broad-band interferometer (without signal recycling), except for new input and/or output optics. Three designs are analyzed: (i) a "squeezed-input interferometer" (conceived by Unruh based on earlier work of Caves) in which squeezed vacuum with frequency-dependent (FD) squeeze angle is injected into the interferometer's dark port; (ii) a "variational-output" interferometer (conceived in a different form by Vyatchanin, Matsko and Zubova), in which homodyne detection with FD homodyne phase is performed on the output light; and (iii) a "squeezed-variational interferometer" with squeezed input and FD-homodyne output. It is shown that the FD squeezed-input light can be produced by sending ordinary squeezed light through two successive Fabry-Perot filter cavities before injection into the interferometer, and FD-homodyne detection can be achieved by sending the output light through two filter cavities before ordinary homodyne detection. With anticipated technology and with laser powers comparable to that planned for LIGO-II, these interferometers can beat the amplitude SQL by factors in the range from 3 to 5, corresponding to event rate increases between \~{}30 and \~{}100 over the rate for a SQL-limited interferometer.},
